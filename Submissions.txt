1. How many hours did you spend on this challenge?

I spent roughly 10 hours to complete this challenge.

2. Describe the features you have implemented.

The first feature I implemented was the only allowing one option to be checked at once. Next, I implemented a feature that disabled the form once the results were shown. I also have a retake quiz button to reset the quiz.

3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.

One difficulty I faced was enabling the show results button to work after all questions had an option. It was hard because I had to find a way to pass information from child to parent components. I accomplished this by keeping track of an integer state and once that integer state hits the length of questions, the button will be enabled.

4. How much time you can spend each week working for DP Developers?

I can spend ~10 hours a week working for DP developers.
